## Blog Post:
Please find a detailed blog on this case study here: [Predictive Modeling for Educational Impact: Decoding Project FundingÂ Approval](https://medium.com/@swayamdash123/predictive-modeling-for-educational-impact-decoding-project-funding-approval-422dde11cc9c)

## Problem Statement:
This project aims to introduce a binary classification model that predicts the successful approval of the projects and securing funding.

## Overview:
The presentation will outline the project's methodology, including data collection and preprocessing, feature selection, model development, and evaluation. It will highlight the machine learning techniques employed, such as feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation metrics. This project's importance extends beyond DonorsChoose.org, as it aims to enhance the quality of education by providing timely support to classrooms in need. By empowering educators and optimizing resource allocation, the project contributes to creating engaging and effective learning environments for students worldwide.

## Conclusion
In this grand saga of data with related text classification, we have barely scratched the surface of what lies ahead. Predictive modeling in educational project funding approval is like a supercharged study buddy that optimizes resource allocation and boosts the quality of education. With the power of data science techniques like feature engineering and model selection, this project has created a binary classification model that can predict project approval likelihood and secure that much-needed funding. <br>
We have put both Naive Bayes and logistic regression models to the test, analyzing textual, numerical, and categorical features. And guess what? Logistic regression came out on top, strutting its stuff like a seasoned teacher who knows all the tricks of the trade. Sorry, Naive Bayes, better luck next time! <br>
Don't forget to check out the future works section in the blog post for the suggested improvements! We've got big plans to enhance our model for the Project Approval Prediction.

## File Details

- The 'EDA and Pre-processing' folder contains the Exploratory Data Analysis and the pre-processing done before modeling. This folder also contains 'DonorsChoosePreprocess.ipynb' which has the code for the cleaning, and feature analysis.
- The 'Model' folder contains the code for the whole project and different models that were applied to the data.
